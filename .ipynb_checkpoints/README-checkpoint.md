This project uses single pitch data to create a tool that will give you the prorbablity of a pitcher throwing a certain pitch in all the various situations in a game. This can be used to help inform a hitter for which pitch may be coming or to aid coaches in learning how big league pitchers sequence and pitch in various spots. Humans are creatures of patterns, especially pitchers. This dataset has 7 million pitches since 2015 and allows the user to choose any pitcher and any situation and it will display what pitch they most likely will throw.
